# DAY 10: Encoding json files using python:
Write a program that prompts the user to input their name, age, and favorite food. Take this input, format it into a dictionary, and then encode and save it to a file named "output.json" using the json.dumps function.


*NOTE: only use built-in libraries of python (do not use pandas etc.)*
